            <p>Once common throughout Africa and Asia, elephant numbers were severely depleted during the 20th century, largely due to the massive ivory trade. While some populations are now stable and growing, poaching, conflict and habitat destruction continue to threaten the species.</p>

                    <h2>Why are the Elephants important? </h2>
                    <p>Elephants directly influence forest composition and density, and can alter the broader landscape. In tropical forests, elephants create clearings and gaps in the canopy that encourage tree regeneration. In the savannas, they reduce bush cover to create an environment favorable to a mix of browsing and grazing animals. </p>
                   <br>
                   <p>Elephants help maintain forest and savanna ecosystems for other species, and are integrally tied to rich biodiversity.</p>

            <h3>ILLEGAL WILDLIFE TRADE</h3>
            <h4>ELEPHANT HABITAT LOSS</h4>
            <p>In 1989, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) banned the international trade in ivory. However, there are still some thriving but unregulated domestic ivory markets in a number of countries, which fuel an illegal international trade. Poaching to meet growing demand from affluent Asian countries is driving up the rate of poaching. In some countries, political unrest contributes to elephant poaching.</p>

                    <h4>&#10148; Back a Ranger</h4>
                    <p>The men and women on the frontlines of conservation are perhaps the most important protectors of the world’s natural and cultural treasures. Rangers work tirelessly to protect endangered species like tigers, elephants and rhinos, which are targeted by poachers for the illegal wildlife trade. They usually earn very little and some go months without receiving their salary or seeing their families.</p>
                    <h4>&#10148; Adopt an African Elephant</h4>
                    <p>African elephants are family-oriented animals with a complex social structure. There are two types of herds — females with their young and bachelor herds — and lone males. Females remain with their natal group for life, sharing responsibility for calves, and males leave the herd once they reach maturity. Elephants are a keystone species and dramatically affect their landscape. They are seed dispersers and influence forest composition, creating clearings to boost tree regrowth and reducing cover to create suitable habitat for browsing and grazing animals.</p>

                            Elephants are among the most intelligent creatures on the planet and have complex emotions. Their lives are being lost to the ivory trade, accelerating habitat and range destruction. You can help put a stop to this and ensure Africa’s elephants are protected for generations to come.</p>
